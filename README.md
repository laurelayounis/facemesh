# FaceMesh React app with Tensorflow js api
This app creates a real time facemesh app using React and Tensorflow js & node



![alt tag](http://placecorgi.com/1200/650)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tensorflow js, Node   
  Began by installing dependencies : tensorflow js : facial landmark ml model: react webcam  
  Nex step was to import dependencies by setting up React webcam & canvas to draw the real time face mesh points using the landmark detection model 
 
  Defined reference to the landmark detection points & loaded real time facemesh detection via triangulation paths using drawMesh to detect the paths


Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

Increase the set interval detection to above 300  
Add an additional Tensorflow js training module to detect real time emotion so this will be a useable project to build an emotional skills training & recognition app
## Lessons Learned:

✔️How to load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model.  
✔️How to grab data from a live webcam stream and draw it to canvas.  
✔️How to integrate it will React to create a real time data stream.  
✔️How to use the data passed back from the model to create a facial mesh.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
